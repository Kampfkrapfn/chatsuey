ChatSuey
========
A collection of chat enhancement addons for vanilla World of Warcraft (WoW 1.12). Learn about all the features at the [project website](http://www.scotthamper.com/chatsuey/).

Installation
------------
1. Copy all the ChatSuey folders into your WoW `Interface\AddOns` directory.
2. If WoW is currently running, exit completely out and restart it.
3. Enable/disable desired addons at the character select screen ("EditOnTop" and "RemoveButtons" are disabled by default).

NOTE: If you're upgrading from an earlier version, delete all the ChatSuey folders from your `Interface\AddOns` directory before copying the new ones over.

Localizations greatly appreciated
---------------------------------
If you're multi-lingual, I could really use your help! I'm only fluent in English, but the following addons could be localized for other languages:

- `ChatSuey`
- `ChatSuey-FontSettings`
- `ChatSuey-MiniChannels`
- `ChatSuey-Timestamps`
- `ChatSuey-WebLinks`

If you'd be willing to help out, take a look at each addon's `i18n\enUS.lua` file to see what needs translating, and let me know by [opening an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ScottHamper/ChatSuey/issues).
