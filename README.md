ChatSuey
========
A collection of chat enhancement addons for vanilla World of Warcraft (WoW 1.12). Learn about all the features at the [project website](http://www.scotthamper.com/chatsuey/).

Installation
------------
1. Copy all the ChatSuey folders into your WoW `Interface\AddOns` directory.
2. Enable/disable desired addons at the character select screen ("EditOnTop" and "RemoveButtons" are disabled by default).

Localizations greatly appreciated
---------------------------------
ChatSuey allows using localized color names with the "Markdown Links" feature. However, I'm only fluent in English, so if you're multi-lingual, I could really use your help! Check out `ChatSuey\i18n\enUS.lua` to see the text that needs translating, and if you'd be willing to help out, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ScottHamper/ChatSuey/issues).
